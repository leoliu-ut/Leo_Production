                This webpage highlights my contribution to this project, including <a href="#Phase1DataDiscovery"> data
                analysis & visualization,</a> and UI
                design for <a href="#InternalEmployeeDashboard">Internal Employee Dashboard,</a> and <a

                <br><br>The Insights Team is responsible for the customer panel management and study/survey design. The
                Internal Employee Dashboard was designed for internal employees to submit their requests. Then, these
                requests would pop up on the Insights Team's dashboard. Also, the Insights Team would follow back the
                answers to the requester after the study's completion. Requesters can check answers on the Internal
                Employee Dashboard. Together, two systems should make a seamless workflow across multiple departments
                and teams.

                <u><b><em>Phase One: Discovery</em></b></u>
                <br>
                Disclaimer: <br> Due to the non‐disclosure agreement with 7-Eleven, the data visualizations presented
                here had been modified significantly.
                They might not have any meaning in real life and should not be used for any commercial activities.
                <br><br>
                I first examined the basic demographic distribution of the dataset we received from 7-Eleven.
                I realized the percentage of Millennials, GenX and Boomers among 7-Eleven customers.
                I also examined gender and household size distribution.

            </p>

        <div class="inner clearfix">
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
                <br>
                Additionally, I found household income distribution and the top 5 occupations.
                I also examined the education level distribution.
            </p>

        <div class="inner clearfix">
            <p style="font-size: 16px">

                I tried to segment these customers into several categories after learning about these basic demographic
                distributions. I came to realize that shopping frequency is likely a meaningful factor to explore after
                consulting with the 7-Eleven employees.
                So I segmented the customers based on their shopping frequency at 7-Eleven.
                I realized the percent of casual shoppers (meaning they usually shop at 7-Eleven 0-5
                times per month), regular shoppers (5-20 times per month), and frequent shoppers (20+ times per
                month).

        <div class="inner clearfix">
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
                These demographic and behavioral findings made a solid foundation for the project. Our recommendations
                in Phases 2 and 3 are based on these findings. For example, when considering recruiting the panelists,
                my teammates and I looked up these findings to select ideal distribution channels. The Insights Team
                could ensure that the panelists are representing the actual customer base as much as possible.

                <u><b><em>Phase Two: Best Practices</em></b></u>
                <br>
                We set out to develop a set of robust recommendations for recruiting, developing, and operating a panel.
                I examined over 100 journal articles and websites for proposing these recommendations. The key
                recommendations and best practices can be grouped into three overarching themes:
                <br><br>
                1. The panel members should feel as appreciated as possible for their role in the panel, by
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul style="font-size: 16px;">
                <li style="list-style: inside circle none;  text-align: left; margin: 0 0 0 5%;">creating a personalized
                    experience for each member;
                </li>
                <li style="list-style: inside circle none;  text-align: left; margin: 0 0 0 5%;">providing active
                    customer supports;
                </li>
                <li style="list-style: inside circle none;  text-align: left; margin: 0 0 0 5%;">using rewards to convey
                    their value to the organization;
                </li>
                <li style="list-style: inside circle none;  text-align: left; margin: 0 0 0 5%;">making it feel less
                    transactional (ex. adding some “fun” questions or quizzes into surveys).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
                <br>
                2. Expectations for the panel are set both internally and externally.
                <br>#Externally
                <br>
                Panelist participants should know how much time is needed to dedicate to the panel and, on a smaller
                scale,
                how much time the individual surveys should take to complete.
                <br>#Internally
                <br>
                The requesting employees and the Insights Team have to be on the same page when it comes to the
                timing and execution of the panel.
                <br><br>
                3. Ensure that the user interface for all parties is simple, efficient, and intuitive to use.
                This is not only to help with the actual execution of the panel and to try and minimize the amount of
                time you might have to allocate to training users to engage with it, but also to allow for easy search,
                theming, and access to past survey requests to help create more dynamic or longitudinal reports when
                needed.

                This is the Internal Employee dashboard mockup. This portal is designed for internal employees to
                request a study. On this homepage, internal employees can check the latest notifications, start a new
                request including urgent ones, view the request history, and check the team member hierarchy tree.
                <br><br>
                Employees can see the timeline and which step the request is currently on. Team members are able to
                collaborate and view past research and filter previous requests and results using employee names and
                keywords. They can also look at the notes about the reasons why the request is rejected. If needed, they
                can modify their submission request. Below are demos for requesting the history page and the note
                demonstration.

                I completely understand the chance that every employee could think of their request as important and
                urgent. To prevent an excessive amount of urgent requests, I plan to introduce the manager's
                supervision. Only with the approval of the manager, the employee's request can be sent to the Insights
                Team and be handled in a faster manner. Here is what the urgent request dashboards look like.

                The Insights Team is responsible for connecting with both internal employees and external panelists. So
                on the homepage, two main categories - panelist management and research study - are presented. For this
                project, we mainly focused on the internal process.

                In the research study section, the Insights Team can check the request from the internal
                employees. I integrated the most important features of each request into one line, including
                urgency, period (when answers are needed), request department, etc. At the end of each line, some action
                buttons are added to move forward - to assign a team member to design the study, and to add this
                question to an existing
                study.
                <br><br>
                The team members also have the right to approve or deny the request question. If the request is denied,
                reasons need to be provided and flow back to the requester; If approved, an internal evaluation system,
                including extra resource consideration, business impact, and customer benefits evaluation, will be
                applied. This system will determine the priority of each request.
                <br><br>
                Each question will be assigned a unique id code for the convenience of the study design.

            <p style="font-size: 16px">
                Here shows what the new study page looks like. On this page, the Insights Team can design studies by
                combining several questions into one study/survey, and giving it a name/subject. The study id is given
                by the system and is non-changeable. Other features, such as category, need to be taken into account
                here. This will help analyze these studies in the future.
                <br><br>
                In case the study is targeted to a specific group of panelists, screening requirements also need to be
                checked at this point. These requirements will be embedded in each study when distributed.
            </p>

        <div class="inner clearfix">
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
                After being saved, a study will be recorded on the Draft page. The team can preview the study, and edit
                it again. I added a Notes function here to help better collaborate among the team members.
                <br><br>
                As I mentioned in the recommendations above, the team should inform the panelists of the time needed to
                complete the study. So an attribute, "Est. Length," is added here.
                <br><br>
                Once the team agrees to release a study, they can click on the "Submit" button. The study will be sent
                to the next page - Schedule.

                After designing the study, the Insights Team will review it one last time and then distribute it. The
                team should set an award type and amount in advance. They are also supposed to set requirements about
                the number of panelists to target, and to be more specific, the number of responses from each channel in
                advance. Once these requirements are met, the team can close the study.

        <div class="inner clearfix">
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
                After the study is closed, the Insights Team will continue to work on data analysis.
                Based on the results, the team will write a report and follow it back to the requester.
                And the requester can check the feedback on their Internal Employee dashboard shown above.
                The most important features on this page are the ability to export, analyze and communicate.
                <br><br>
                The team needs to evaluate the study performance, such as the reward redemption rate, survey response
                rate, and other useful metrics as the panel develops. These could be beneficial to the future
                developments of survey design and the rewards system.
                <br><br>
                Such self-evaluation could also help gauge the insight team’s efficacy. The team can track the time they
                spent in each step. For example, how long did they approve the request; how many days did they spend in
                designing the study; how long does it need to collect enough data, and more.
                <br><br>
                Also, I added a filter function to sort and organize these archive studies easily and some other
                functions such as reactivate, in case this is a recurring study.
